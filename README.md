#Operating Systems Project
This is a small project for the Operating Systems course, divided into 3 parts:
  Shell: In this part, I designed and built a shell user interface that includes multiple custom commands.
  Memory: This part of the project introduced me to the principles of memory management by implementing a memory manager to dynamically allocate memory in a program.
  Concurrency: The final part of the project focuses on concurrency, where I learned about the mechanics of concurrency and common synchronization problems through implementations of threads, locks, condition variables, and semaphores.

All three project parts are implemented in the C programming language and include explanations and screenshots of outputs.
